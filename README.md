# CAR-RENTAL-SYSTEM-AND-ROUTE-SUGGESTION-USING-DIJKSTRA-S-ALGORITHM

As the requirement in this difficult times of covid -19 where people were not able to travel because of high risk of getting affected we have developed this car rental system. 
Car Rental System is based on the concept to rent cars, to select a car from the given list of cars along with the money you have to pay to rent a car from the company.
We have used dijkstra algorithm to make the car rental system more advance as now it is able to suggest shortest path to the user input destination from the source location.
Our aim with this project is to provide a better car renting system to the people of india. 

## Problem statement :
A rental car is time specific, which means that the service could be used very specifically and also the rent increases with increase in time.
Making use of this kind of service is very convenient but for those who are not so connected with web, the service is of no use. Individual may require a smart device to make use of it.
The system is designed in the way that it automatically generates the fare according to the distance, so the passenger could not be cheated and will pay the right fare.
